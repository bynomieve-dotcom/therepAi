Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. Just three breaths can help ground you. You\u2019re doing your best!"

It can be a simple way to express what\u2019s going on inside. Remember, it\u2019s okay to take things one step at a time!"

How about taking a moment to close your eyes and think of one thing that brings you a little bit of comfort or joy? It could be a memory, a person, or even a favorite place. Just hold onto that thought for a moment. You're not alone in this!"

How about taking a moment to stretch your body gently? Just a simple stretch, reaching your arms up high and then letting them fall back down, can help release some tension. You're doing great just by being here!"
